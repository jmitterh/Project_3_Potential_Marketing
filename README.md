# Project 3: Data-Estate

Team:
* Jean-Paul Mitterhofer
* Mahathi Veluri 
* Baoxing Wang
* Xiaodi Lin

## Project Description

Creating a Dashboard of the Potential tenants so Commercial Real-Estate Companies can target clients per mile radius. Map of building locations with new and established companies around a 5 mile radius for each building. A list on the left side panel displaying company name, similar to a google map search. This can possibly change as we further understand our data; might try using historical economic trends that tell what areas to market to based on zip code or something similar.
